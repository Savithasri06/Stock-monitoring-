The Real-Time Stock Monitoring and Alert System is a simple and useful tool that helps users keep track of stock prices instantly. It allows users to enter stock symbols (like TCS, INFY, or AAPL) and set price limits. When the stock price goes above or below the set limit, the system gives a sound or message alert.
